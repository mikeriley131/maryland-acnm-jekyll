            <span class="label lu">Legislative Update</span>

            <h2>November Legislative Update</h2>
            <p>Two sets of regulations are currently open for comment, and moving towards approval in Maryland.</p>

            <p>The first is the Direct Entry Midwifery Regulations. The law authorizing the practice of CPMs in Maryland under the title Licensed Direct Entry Midwife (LDEM) is very detailed. For this reason, the regulations have many details that are dictated by the law; these cannot be altered at this time. LDEMs who were educated under the PEP process, rather than in a MEAC accredited education program, are completing a bridge program that closely resembles the national bridge certificate program supported by the US MERA process and offered through NARM. When the regulations are approved, Maryland CPMs will be able to be licensed and practice legally in the home setting. Two CNMs serve on the Board of Nursing DEM Advisory Committee. The MD ACNM Affiliate is supporting the regulations.</p>

            <p>Second is the birth center regulations. These are being amended to permit the practice of ultrasound in birth centers by CNMs qualified in the procedure. ACNM is also supporting this regulatory change.</p>

            <p>The legislative session opens in January. Preliminary work for the session will begin later this fall. Midwives wishing to work on this committee need to be able to participate in regular conference calls before and during session. They may also be called on to participate in lobbying visits or testimony in Annapolis. We are looking for a diverse group. Please contact <a href="mailto&#58;ck&#37;&#54;5&#110;&#110;&#101;&#37;40&#37;67m%61%69&#108;%2Eco%6D">Colleen Kennedy</a>, Affiliate Chair, or Jan Kriebs, Legislative Co-Chair, to discuss participating.</p>

                    <p>Catherine Salam – On faculty at Shenandoah, retired from Chase Brexton last year. Would serve as bridge between the “old” guard and “new” guard in the affiliate. Now that she is semi-retired, she’d like to share her expertise. Rare to see midwives represented from across the state – would be a good initiative to see that this affiliate represents them. Utilize technology to do this.</p>

            <span class="label lu">Legislative Update</span>

            <h2>Maryland Legislative Blog</h2>
            <p>by Jan Kriebs, July 2016</p>

            <p>This year the ACNM Maryland Legislative Committee and our lobbyist Robyn Elliott of Public Policy Partners provided input to the Maryland Legislature on 35 unique pieces of legislation. Press events, written and oral testimony, office visits to legislators and a last ditch email/phone campaign all helped support the practice of midwifery in Maryland. Thanks to everyone who called and emailed about the Medical Cannabis Act- it is featured this quarter because without the support of our members and members of the broader nursing community it would not have passed. In future posts, we will talk about the Maternity Access Coalition, contraceptive equity, and direct entry midwifery.</p>

            <h3>Medical Cannabis</h3>
            <p>Until this year, only physicians could be certified as providers who authorize the use of medical marijuana to a patient. Provider applications will be available soon for midwives and other providers who have prescriptive authority and who want to offer medical marijuana to non-pregnant women. According to the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission, medical marijuana can be prescribed for chronic diseases or medical problems that cause severe loss of appetite, severe or chronic pain, severe nausea, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as well as other conditions. Patients must have a written certification from the provider and have a bona fide relationship with the provider.</p>

            <p>Although few midwives will have appropriate patients for medical cannabis, the bill was important to Maryland CNMS as a matter of principle, to preserve full prescriptive authority (i.e., without restrictions compared to other APRNs practicing in primary care settings). The legislation became unexpectedly contentious when a few pharmacists misrepresented both the scope of practice and clinical abilities of CNMs in testimony.</p>

            <p>When the final bill passed, CNMs remained in, largely due to three factors. First, the ACNM Affiliate has a lobbyist who works long and hard on our behalf as well as having many relationships and other clients within the larger nursing community. Second, both the Maryland Nurses Association and the Nurse Practitioner Association of Maryland sent out blast emails to members, as did ACNM, urging members to call legislators with a specific, well-crafted message. The message supported midwives and pointed out that nurses make up a large part of the health care community.  Third, Delegate Morhaim and Senator Raskin continued their vocal support for CNMs to remain in the bill throughout the process.</p>

            <p>More information is available from the <a href="http://mmcc.maryland.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission website</a> (although it does not yet list CNMs as authorized providers).</p>

            <h3>HIV Testing in Pregnancy</h3>
            <p>Third trimester testing for HIV is now required unless the woman opts-out after being offered the test. Only the District of Columbia and Louisiana have higher rates of HIV transmission to women than Maryland does. Best practice is to obtain written consent that includes all tests, and document which tests are declined.</p>

            <h3>Board of Nursing</h3>
            <p>A ‘clean-up’ bill for the Board of Nursing removed outdated language and created the opportunity for CNMs and advanced practice nurses to have advisory peer committees. It also established new rules and penalties for being an ‘imposter’ - holding oneself out as legally able to practice without being properly licensed.</p>
