            <h2>Maryland Legislative Blog</h2>
            <p>by Jan Kriebs, July 2016</p>

            <p>This year the ACNM Maryland Legislative Committee and our lobbyist Robyn Elliott of Public Policy Partners provided input to the Maryland Legislature on 35 unique pieces of legislation. Press events, written and oral testimony, office visits to legislators and a last ditch email/phone campaign all helped support the practice of midwifery in Maryland. Thanks to everyone who called and emailed about the Medical Cannabis Act- it is featured this quarter because without the support of our members and members of the broader nursing community it would not have passed. In future posts, we will talk about the Maternity Access Coalition, contraceptive equity, and direct entry midwifery.</p>

            <h3>Medical Cannabis</h3>
            <p>Until this year, only physicians could be certified as providers who authorize the use of medical marijuana to a patient. Provider applications will be available soon for midwives and other providers who have prescriptive authority and who want to offer medical marijuana to non-pregnant women. According to the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission, medical marijuana can be prescribed for chronic diseases or medical problems that cause severe loss of appetite, severe or chronic pain, severe nausea, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as well as other conditions. Patients must have a written certification from the provider and have a bona fide relationship with the provider.</p>

            <p>Although few midwives will have appropriate patients for medical cannabis, the bill was important to Maryland CNMS as a matter of principle, to preserve full prescriptive authority (i.e., without restrictions compared to other APRNs practicing in primary care settings). The legislation became unexpectedly contentious when a few pharmacists misrepresented both the scope of practice and clinical abilities of CNMs in testimony.</p>

            <p>When the final bill passed, CNMs remained in, largely due to three factors. First, the ACNM Affiliate has a lobbyist who works long and hard on our behalf as well as having many relationships and other clients within the larger nursing community. Second, both the Maryland Nurses Association and the Nurse Practitioner Association of Maryland sent out blast emails to members, as did ACNM, urging members to call legislators with a specific, well-crafted message. The message supported midwives and pointed out that nurses make up a large part of the health care community.  Third, Delegate Morhaim and Senator Raskin continued their vocal support for CNMs to remain in the bill throughout the process.</p>

            <p>More information is available from the <a href="http://mmcc.maryland.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission website</a> (although it does not yet list CNMs as authorized providers).</p>

            <h3>HIV Testing in Pregnancy</h3>
            <p>Third trimester testing for HIV is now required unless the woman opts-out after being offered the test. Only the District of Columbia and Louisiana have higher rates of HIV transmission to women than Maryland does. Best practice is to obtain written consent that includes all tests, and document which tests are declined.</p>

            <h3>Board of Nursing</h3>
            <p>A ‘clean-up’ bill for the Board of Nursing removed outdated language and created the opportunity for CNMs and advanced practice nurses to have advisory peer committees. It also established new rules and penalties for being an ‘imposter’ - holding oneself out as legally able to practice without being properly licensed.</p>
