          <h4>Maryland</h4>

          <p>Maryland’s General Assembly is a citizen-based legislature made up of 141 elected delegates and 47 senators for a total of 188. Each legislative district is made up of one senator and three delegates who are voted into office by their constituents every four years.</p>

          <p>The Maryland General Assembly convenes every year for 90 days from early January until mid-April. During the 90-day legislative session, legislators will consider over 2,500 pieces of proposed legislation and will pass approximately 700 bills that will become law.</p>
